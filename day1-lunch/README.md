# QBB2022 - Day 1 - Lunch Exercises Submission

 1. Iâ€™m excited to learn how, in python, to make one boolean reverse another in response to a command in a state based way.
 
 The mean number of exons per gene was 63.
 
 I got this by first going into the day 1 lunch directory via the cd command, then used the wc command with the -l modifier to get a count of the number of lines.
 
 I would get the median by 
 
 1.  finding a way to get the program to check if the start and end chromosome positions of a given exon are within the bounds of a given gene
 
 2.  creating a set of exons for each gene
 
3.  converting the exons for each gene into numbers of exons

4.  finding the median of that data set
