A couple big comments/requests: I would suggest writing out your exact code. It makes it easier for the TAs/instructors to make sure you know what you're doing, and it will also make it easier to come back and see what you did later. In the same vein, please label which question you're answering in each part of your README (i.e. mark it 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, etc.).

Quesiton 2c: This sounds like a good idea. How would you convert the "exons for each gene" into a number of exons per gene?
Question 3c: Yeah, this sounds like a good idea! Maybe only do one state at a time so you don't have to worry about summing for each state all at once.

Good start! Make sure to finish up the rest of the questions, and definitely please try to update your formatting!
